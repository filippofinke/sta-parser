    Visitor class for traversing the SensorThings API abstract syntax tree (AST).

    This class provides a visit method that can be used to traverse the AST.
    It dynamically calls visit methods based on the type of the node being visited.
    If no specific visit method is available for a particular node type, it falls back
    to the generic_visit method.

    Attributes:
        None

    Methods:
        visit(node): Traverse the AST by visiting each node in a depth-first manner.
        generic_visit(node): Default visit method called when no specific visit method is available for a node type.
